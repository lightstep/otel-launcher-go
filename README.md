# Launcher, a Lightstep Distro for OpenTelemetry ðŸš€

### What is Launcher?

Launcher is a configuration layer that chooses default values for configuration options that many OpenTelemetry users want. It provides a single function in each language to simplify discovery of the options and components available to users. The goal of Launcher is to help users that aren't familiar with OpenTelemetry quickly ramp up on what they need to get going and instrument.

### Getting started

```bash
go get github.com/lightstep/otel-launcher-go/launcher
```

### Configure

Minimal setup

```go
import "github.com/lightstep/otel-launcher-go/launcher"

func main() {
    otel := launcher.ConfigureOpentelemetry(
        launcher.WithServiceName("service-name"),
        launcher.WithAccessToken("access-token"),
    )
    defer otel.Shutdown()
}
```

For non-lightstep providers, you can set headers directly instead.

```go
import "github.com/lightstep/otel-launcher-go/launcher"

func main() {
    otel := launcher.ConfigureOpentelemetry(
        launcher.WithServiceName("service-name"),
        launcher.WithHeaders(map[string]string{
            "service-auth-key": "value",
            "service-useful-field": "testing",
        }),
    )
    defer otel.Shutdown()
}
```

### Principles behind Launcher

#### 100% interoperability with OpenTelemetry

One of the key principles behind putting together Launcher is to make lives of OpenTelemetry users easier, this means that there is no special configuration that **requires** users to install Launcher in order to use OpenTelemetry. It also means that any users of Launcher can leverage the flexibility of configuring OpenTelemetry as they need.

#### Validation

Another decision we made with launcher is to provide end users with a layer of validation of their configuration. This provides us the ability to give feedback to our users faster, so they can start collecting telemetry sooner.

Start using it today in [Go](https://github.com/lightstep/otel-launcher-go), [Java](https://github.com/lightstep/otel-launcher-java), [Javascript](https://github.com/lightstep/otel-launcher-node) and [Python](https://github.com/lightstep/otel-launcher-python) and let us know what you think!

### OpenTelemetry Metrics support

### Lightstep Metrics SDK

**WARNING**: This SDK is new and is still undergoing early production
testing at Lightstep.  Please use this SDK with caution until further
notice.

The Launcher contains an alternative to the [OTel-Go community Metrics
SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go) being
maintained by Lightstep as a way to quickly validate newer
OpenTelemetry features, such as the OpenTelemetry exponential
histogram.

The community SDK is used by default.  To select the alternative
Metrics SDK, use `WithLightstepMetricsSDK(true)` or set
`LS_METRICS_SDK=true`.

The differences between the OpenTelemetry Metrics SDK specification
and the alternative SDK are documented in its
[README](./lightstep/sdk/metric/README.md).

### Metrics Temporality settings

OpenTelemetry metrics SDKs give the user control over "temporality",
which is the selection of "delta" or "cumulative" policies for
aggregating Counter and Histogram instruments.  These settings determine
both memory usage and reliability of metrics reporting.

Delta temporality requires less memory than cumulative temporality for
synchronous instruments, while Cumulative requires less memory than
delta temporality for asynchronous instruments.  When reporting is
intermittent, cumulative series will average out the missing reports,
whereas delta series will have gaps.

Note that Lightstep considers a change of temporality to be a breaking
change.  Once a temporality preference has been set, the setting has
to be maintained.  The temporality preference is configured by calling
`WithMetricExporterTemporalityPreference()` or using the
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRIC_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE` environment
variable.

The exporter temporality preference is set to "cumulative" by default,
as per the OpenTelemetry SDK specification.  The OpenTelemetry
specified "delta" temporality preference is not recommended for
Lightstep users.

The launcher supports an experimental "stateless" temporality
preference.  This selection configures the ideal behavior for
Lightstep by mixing temporality setings.  This setting uses delta
temporality for synchronous Counter and Histogram instruments, while
using cumulative temporality for asynchronous Counters.  Note that
synchronous and asynchronous UpDownCounter instruments are specified
to use cumulative temporality in OpenTelemetry metrics SDKs
independent of the temporality preference.

### Metrics validation errors

Lightstep performs a number of validation steps over metrics data
before accepting it.  When an OTLP Metrics export request is
successful but data is completely or partially rejected for any
reason, the outcome is detailed using Lightstep-specific response
headers. 

These headers predate [work in OpenTelemetry on returning partial
success](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/pull/390).
Lightstep expects to use standard OTLP fields to convey these
partially-successful outcomes in the future.

Validation errors are generally repetitive.  Lightstep limits the size
of each partial-success response to lower the overhead associated with
these responses using random selection.

The launcher contains special code to interpret these headers and
direct them to the standard OpenTelemetry-Go error handler.
